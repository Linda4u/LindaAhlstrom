If you don't have a food processor coarsely chop the oats in a blender and add to a bowl.</p><p class='instruction'>Add the flaxseed meal, nut butter, honey, vanilla and salt. Process/mix until the mixture comes together into a soft but not overly sticky ball.</p><p class='instruction'>If the mixture is overly dry, add nut butter a tablespoon at a time and process/mix until the consistency is soft but not overly sticky or crumbly.</p><p class='instruction'>Remove the blade from the food processor, if using. Add any add-in ingredients, and mix with your hands until evenly combined.</p><p class='instruction'>Roll the dough into small balls (I use my small cookie scoop - #60) and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet or tray. Refrigerate until firm enough to stack in a lidded container or in a bag. The energy bites can be frozen for several months or refrigerated for a week or so.</p><p class='instruction'>NOTES Nut Butter: as far as nut butter, I've tried these with almond butter, peanut butter (both natural and Skippy-types), and cashew butter. My favorite combo is half peanut butter/half cashew butter (to die for). Almond butter is my least favorite of the options, but that's just personal preference (my kids like it less, too) - the texture of the bites tends to be a bit grainier.</p><p class='instruction'>﻿Consistency: for the overall consistency of these energy bites, a lot will depend on how coarsely the oats are chopped in the first step and the thickness of the nut butter (for instance, cashew butter and natural peanut butter are sometimes runnier). If you are using a nut butter with a thinner consistency, start with the 2/3 cup amount and add more, if needed.</p><p class='instruction'>© MEL</p><h2 class='recipe-title'><strong>Chili Soup</strong></h2><br><p class='instruction'></p><p class='ingredient'>2 T oil</p><p class='ingredient'>1 onion, chopped</p><p class='instruction'>Salt and pepper – ½ tsp each</p><p class='ingredient'>2 cloves of garlic (2 tsp chopped garlic)</p><p class='ingredient'>1 T chili powder</p><p class='ingredient'>2 tsp ground cumin</p><p class='ingredient'>1 lb ground beef</p><p class='ingredient'>3 (14.5 oz) canned beans (drained) pinto, black, kidney, white or garbanzo – a variety is nice!</p><p class='ingredient'>1 can or 1 cup frozen corn (drained) – if frozen add right before soup is ready to eat</p><p class='ingredient'>2 (14.5 oz) can of diced fire roasted tomatoes – can use salsa style tomatoes with green chili</p><p class='ingredient'>2 (4oz) diced green chili – only if you don’t buy tomatoes that already have chili in them</p><p class='ingredient'>2 cups chicken or beef broth (two cups water with 2 tsp of Knorr bouillon)</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Heat the oil in large pot over medium heat.

Some recipes like this call for one can of cream of chicken soup. Okay to also add extra can of beans.  Add some extra water if it’s salty or if you like more liquid. Easy shelf stable ingredients make it perfect for 3 month supply meal.</p><h2 class='recipe-title'><strong>Whole Wheat Bread</strong></h2><br><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Grind 10 cups of whole wheat berries (yields approximately 16 cups of flour)</p><p class='instruction'></p><h3 class='ingredients-title'><strong>Mix the following in a Bosch Universal with dough hook:</strong></h3><p class='ingredient'>5 cups warm water, approximately 115 degrees</p><p class='ingredient'>2 T. salt</p><p class='instruction'>2/3 cup canola oil</p><p class='instruction'>2/3 cup honey</p><p class='instruction'>Fresh ground flour – start with 5 cups, then add more later</p><p class='ingredient'>3 T dough enhancer (or try 2 T. lemon juice or vinegar)</p><p class='instruction'>1/3 cup vital wheat gluten OR 2 cups high gluten bread flour</p><p class='ingredient'>3 T SAF or Costco yeast</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Use the momentary switch (M) to mix well.  Turn the machine to speed 1 and continue to add more wheat flour.  Quickly add enough flour until the dough begins to pull from the sides of the bowl. When you can see the sides pull clean as well as the dough coming clean from the bottom of the bowl you know you have enough flour.  Do not add too much flour – the dough should be sticky and does not come together at this point, but the bowl in clean.   If you feel your dough is too dry, simply add a few tablespoons of water to moisten.  If dough starts sticking simply add a little white flour to take up the moisture.  Knead on speed 1 for 8-10 minutes or until the gluten has been developed.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Oil your hands, remove dough from mixer and place on a slightly oiled counter.  Divide your dough into 4-5 loaves.  If you have a scale then weigh the dough – each loaf should be about 1½ - 2 pounds.  The dough amount will never be exact because the flour is not measured, and the weather/climate is different each day.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Shape loaves, and place in well greased or sprayed (PAM) pan, never use oil.  I like the 8 ½ by 4 ½ pan.  Cover with a dry towel or oiled Saran wrap.  Let rise until dough has risen double, approximately 2 inches above the rim of the pan.  This will take about an hour or so, but it depends on the room temperature.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Bake in preheated oven at 350° for 25-35 minutes, or until the inside temperature is 195-200°.  An instant read thermometer is very useful in telling whether your bread is done.   Test after baking time is complete by taking bread out of the pan and pushing the thermometer into the side or bottom of loaf.  If not 195-200°, bake a few more minutes.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Take bread out of pans and cool on racks.  Place bread in bags as soon as the bread is cool enough.  If you won’t be eating 4 loaves within a few days, then place bread in freezer the same day you made it.</p><p class='instruction'></p><h2 class='recipe-title'><strong>Honey Butter</strong></h2><br><p class='ingredient'>1 cube butter, softened</p><p class='instruction'>½ cup honey</p><p class='instruction'>Combine honey and butter.  Beat with electric mixer, or in Bosch with French Whips.  Store in refrigerator</p><h2 class='recipe-title'><strong>PERFECT WHOLE WHEAT BREAD</strong></h2><br><p class='instruction'>{SMALL BATCH; TWO LOAVES}</p><p class='instruction'>yield: 24 SLICES (2 LOAVES)</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>prep time: 45 MINS</p><p class='instruction'>cook time: 30 MINS</p><p class='instruction'>total time: 1 HR 15 MINS</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>INGREDIENTS</p><p class='instruction'>5-6 cups (710 to 852 g) whole wheat flour, I prefer white whole wheat vs red whole wheat</p><p class='ingredient'>1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast</p><p class='instruction'>1/4 cup vital wheat gluten (see note)</p><p class='ingredient'>2 3/4 cups warm water</p><p class='ingredient'>1 tablespoon lemon juice, bottled or fresh</p><p class='instruction'>1/3 cup oil</p><p class='instruction'>1/3 cup (113 g) honey</p><p class='ingredient'>1 tablespoon salt</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>INSTRUCTIONS</p><p class='instruction'>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix together 3 cups of the whole wheat flour, yeast, and gluten. Add the warm water and mix well. Cover the bowl and let the mixture rest for 10-12 minutes.</p><p class='instruction'>Add the lemon juice, oil, honey, and salt. Mix on low speed.</p><p class='instruction'>With the mixer running on low speed, continue adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl (don't overflour! A little stickiness is ok as long as the dough forms a ball and doesn't leave a lot of residue on your fingers).</p><p class='instruction'>Let the mixer knead the dough for 5-6 minutes until the dough is soft and smooth.</p><p class='instruction'>Turn the dough onto a lightly greased counter and divide in half. Shape each half into a taut loaf and place in a lightly greased loaf pan (8 1/2- X 4 1/2-inches).</p><p class='instruction'>Cover the loaf pans and let the loaves rise until they are 1-2 inches above the edge of the loaf pan.</p><p class='instruction'>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make sure an oven rack is in the middle/center position. Bake the loaves for 28-32 minutes until golden and baked through (an instant-read thermometer should register 180-190 degrees in the center of the loaf).</p><p class='instruction'>Turn the bread onto a wire rack. Brush the tops with butter, if desired. Let cool completely.</p><p class='instruction'>NOTES</p><p class='instruction'>Letting the Dough Rise: this bread recipe does not require the dough to rise before being shaped into loaves and letting the loaves rise in the bread pans. However, if you find your bread is a little dense after baking and cooling, letting the dough rise after kneading may help with that, as well as making sure the dough isn't overfloured.</p><p class='instruction'>Vital Wheat Gluten: is often found in the baking aisle at the grocery store (near the flour). Many brands of vital wheat gluten have Vitamin C added; those are ok to use I this recipe.  I usually buy my gluten from Amazon – the Bob’s Red Mill brand or the Honeyville brand.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'>Peasant Bread Recipe, Simplified</p><p class='ingredient'>4 cups (512 g | 1 lb. 2 oz) unbleached all-purpose flour                                                                          2 teaspoons kosher salt</p><p class='ingredient'>2 cups lukewarm water*</p><p class='ingredient'>2 teaspoons sugar                                                                                                                                          2 teaspoons active-dry or instant yeast</p><p class='ingredient'>room temperature butter, about 2 tablespoons</p><p class='instruction'>*To make foolproof lukewarm water that will not kill the yeast (water that's too hot can kill yeast), boil some water — I use my teapot. Then, mix 11⁄2 cups cold water with 1⁄2 cup boiling water. This ratio of hot to cold water will be the perfect temperature for the yeast. Instructions</p><p class='instruction'>**Special Equipment: You need two 1-qt oven-safe glass bowls</p><h3 class='ingredients-title'><strong>Mixing the dough:</strong></h3><p class='instruction'>• If you are using active-dry yeast: In a small mixing bowl, dissolve the sugar into the water. Sprinkle the yeast over top. There is no need to stir it up. Let it stand for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is foamy and/or bubbling just a bit — this step will ensure that the yeast is active. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. When the yeast-water- sugar mixture is foamy, stir it up, and add it to the flour bowl. Mix until the flour is absorbed.</p><p class='instruction'>• If you are using instant yeast: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Add the water. Mix until the flour is absorbed.</p><p class='instruction'>Cover bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour. (In the winter or if you are letting the bread rise in a cool place, it might take as long as two hours to rise.) This is how to create a slightly warm spot for your bread to rise in: Turn the oven on at any temperature (350°F or so) for one minute, then turn it off. Note: Do not allow the oven to get up to 300°F, for example, and then heat at that setting for 1 minute — this will be too hot. Just let the oven preheat for a total of 1 minute — it likely won't get above 100°F. The goal is to just create a slightly warm environment for the bread.</p><p class='instruction'>Preheat the oven to 425°F. Grease two oven-safe bowls (such as the 1-qt pyrex bowls I mentioned above) with about a tablespoon of butter each. Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to turn the dough up onto itself if that makes sense. You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, and you want to make sure you've punched it down. Then, take your two forks and divide the dough into two equal portions — eye the center of the mass of dough, and starting from the center and working out, pull the dough apart with the two forks. Then scoop up each half and place into your prepared bowls. This part can be a little messy — the dough is very wet and will slip all over the place. Using small forks or forks with short tines</p><p class='instruction'>makes this easier — my small salad forks work best; my dinner forks make it harder. It's best to scoop it up fast and plop it in the bowl in one fell swoop.</p><p class='instruction'>Let the dough rise for about 20 to 30 minutes on the countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just below or above (depending on what size bowl you are using) the top of the bowls. (Note: Do not do the warm-oven trick for the second rise, and do not cover your bowls for the second rise. Simply set your bowls on top of your oven, so that they are in a warm spot. Twenty minutes in this spot usually is enough for my loaves.)</p><p class='instruction'>Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375o and make for 15 to 17 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and turn the loaves onto cooling racks. If you've greased the bowls well, the loaves should fall right out onto the cooling racks. If the loaves look a little pale and soft when you've turned them out onto your cooling racks, place the loaves into the oven (outside of their bowls) and let them bake for about 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p><p class='instruction'></p></body></html>
