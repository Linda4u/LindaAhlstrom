    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Tomatillos</li><li>1 clove of Garlic</li><li>2 Tablespoons crushed red pepper</li><li>½ teaspoon salt (heaping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash tomatillos boil in 1 cup of water with the crushed red pepper in saucepan. Turn tomatillos over as they boil occasionally. When the color has changed on all sides remove from heat both the tomatillos and peppers will change color. Let this sit 5 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile peel 1 clove of garlic and place it in the bender. Add tomatillo mixture with all the water into the blender with the garlic add ½ teaspoon of salt this should be slightly heaping. I also like to add a small amount of onion at this point to the blender a couple of larger pieces of an onion wedge.</li><li>Blend everything up but not too much blending. You can leave it as is or add ½ cup chopped cilantro and 1 medium chopped onion.</li>
    </ol>
