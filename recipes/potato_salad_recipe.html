    <h1>Potato Salad</h1>
    <h2>By Linda Ahlstrom</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 to 12 medium potatoes, boiled then diced</li>
        <li>2 to 4 large stalks of celery, chopped</li>
        <li>6 boiled eggs, chopped</li>
        <li>2 or 3 dill pickles, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup Mayo</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water. Check to see if they are tender and a fork slides through them easily. Over boiling them will make the potato salad mushy or creamy which is not necessarily a bad thing. Make sure they are soft though; under cooking them is not good.</li>
        <li>Run the cooked whole potatoes under cold water and peel the skins off. Dice into large chunks then add to a bowl with eggs, pickles, and celery. I like lots of celery. You can do more than 4 stalks if you want. Get all these ingredients in the fridge; you want them cold before adding the dressing if possible.</li>
        <li>Make the dressing by whisking together mayo, honey, pickle juice, and salt and pepper. You are going for a nice sweet and sour balance; just taste it. You want lots of dressing for a moist potato salad. Add extra milk if you think it needs to be runny. You want it fairly runny to coat all the potatoes well. You can substitute lots of things for the sweet and sour taste. You can add sugar instead of honey. Sometimes the honey dissolves easier. You could use lemon or lime juice for the sour. Mix all that together and salt and pepper to taste, then pour over the rest of the ingredients and stir well.</li>
    </ol>
